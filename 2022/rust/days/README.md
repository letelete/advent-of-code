# AoC 22

You may be wondering, why some of the solutions are written in JS ü§¢ and not Rust ü¶Ä...

**‚ö†Ô∏è JS solutions are drafts only, they were used to score stars of a day.**

Some of them were edited/changed meanwhile, so some of them may not provide a valid output

For the "walk-through" solution I use the language I feel the most comfortable with and code the quickest (JS). I do it with intention to eventually rewriting it to Rust. It's simply because, I've just started to learn Rust, and I need some more time to grasp some of the concepts. Additionally, I have very limited time too, so it'll take extra to accomplish the full rewrite.
